# Whitetail in Missouri

## Habitat
Deer live in timbered areas, especially at the borders of clearings, where they obtain the variety of foods they like; this includes woodlands adjacent to agricultural crops. The major aspects of deer management in Missouri have been controlling the annual harvest by hunters, transplanting live-trapped deer to stock new ranges, and preventing illegal kills. Some landowners wish to increase the deer population on their property; others wish to exclude deer, which forage on crops and trees.

## Diet
Deer are browsing animals, eating the leaves, twigs, and fruits of trees and shrubs, and the foliage of herbaceous plants. They also take seeds, fungi, mosses, lichens, succulent grasses, farm crops, and sometimes small amounts of animal food like snails and fish.

## Chronic Wasting Disease
A variety of diseases and parasites can affect deer, but the most worrisome disease today is chronic wasting disease (CWD), which was detected in our state in 2010. CWD causes abnormal behavior, loss of body function leading to emaciation, and eventually death. CWD is a slowly progressing syndrome that may take more than a year for clinical signs to appear. During the prolonged period between infection and clinical signs of CWD, infected cervids (deer and elk) excrete infectious materials into the environment via defecation, urination, salivation, and so on, ultimately resulting in transmission of the disease to other cervids. CWD may also be spread directly through the natural movements of infected free-ranging cervids, as well as the interstate movement of infected captive cervids. Indirect transmission may occur through movement of infected carcasses and offal from hunter-harvested cervids and also from contaminated soil and water sources. Once established in a local deer population, CWD will slowly increase in prevalence, causing reduced survival rates leading to long-term population declines.
